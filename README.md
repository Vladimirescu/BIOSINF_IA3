|  Group Project: Submission  | Sunday before presentation |

See below for more details about each deadline.


## üë• Student Lectures:

Students will form **groups of up to 2** and jointly develop a lecture on an assigned topic to be delivered on an assigned date. Each group member must deliver a portion of the presentation. The topics should be chosen from the [following list](GroupPresentation.md), highlighting the current State-of-the-Art (SoA) and discussing a range of applications related to the subject.

**‚ùóTime allocated for presentation: 30-35 minutes.**

**‚ùóTime allocated for questions: 5-10 minutes.**

The following grading rules will be applied:

| **Name** | **Description** | **Grade / Penalties** |
|:-------:|:--------:|:---------------------:|
| Initial signup | After the Introductory lecture students will have to choose a topic and secure a date for their presentation. The Sheet will be made-availabe on the Teams platform in the first lecture.  Topic assignment is first come, first served. | **Students who fail to signup for a presentation date until deadline will be penalised by 50% of their final grade for this activity** |
| | | |
| Outline and Bibliography | By the end of Sunday the week before you are scheduled to present, one member of the group must send Ana and Vlad (by mail or Teams) a brief outline and list of references you plan to cover. This is a real deadline -- failure to submit the outline on time will forfeit this portion of the grade for your team and may negatively affect the final presentation grade. | 5p |
| | | |
| Slides | By the end of the day before the scheduled presentation, the group must send Ana and Vlad the slides in **PDF format**, to be made available to all the students on the course webpage. Be sure to put your names on the title slide and an extended reading list on the final slide. Late submission of the slides will forfeit this portion of the grade. Please see the note on credit attribution below, as failure to follow those guidelines will negatively affect this portion of your grade. | 5p |
| | | |
| Peer grading | A small portion of your rgade for this activity will correspond to the average grade provided by your colleagues in their peer reviews. See [this section](#peer-grading-reports) for more details. | 5p |
| | | |
| Lecture presentation | he presentations will be graded based on clarity, technical depth, successful synthesis of content from multiple papers, ability to involve the rest students, and the answers on the questions raised from both profesors and other students. | 15p |
| | | |
| Failure to present within the allocated time | - | -5p |

 ### **Guidelines for creating a successful presentation:**

- The initial refernces are not meant to be binding. You should feel free to modify them based on your interest and judgment. Your goal is to identify a thematically coherent group of significant papers that will make for a presentation of high educational value. You are not expected to cover every part of every paper, and your presentation typically should not be organized as a sequence of single-paper summaries. Aim for 5‚Äì8 core papers, depending on their length and complexity.

- Think of yourselves as professors for a day. You should strive to give a comprehensive and understandable lecture introducing the class to a specific topic. It is important to find the right level of technical depth for the audience, to expose the core technical ideas without going into excessive or overwhelming detail. Some presentations will be more like tutorials and some more like surveys, but most should try to identify at least one main takeaway idea that can be taught in reasonable depth to the class.

- When preparing your slides, and especially when merging slides provided by different group members, pay particular attention to integration. Make sure that slides covering different topics or papers have a consistent organization, level of detail, and notation. Think about the overall "story" you will tell as you are going from one paper to the next.

- Be sure to place your topic in the context of the entire course. Whenever appropriate, take care to point out any specific connections to other presentations that came before.

- Where appropriate, feel free to bring a critical perspective to your topic. Go beyond simply describing the techniques. Compare and contrast different papers, question assumptions, expose possible flaws and limitations, suggest alternatives and/or directions for future research. Keep in mind that some of the papers you are covering may not be peer reviewed yet, making skepticism about any extraordinary/unsubstantiated claims warranted (and exercise caution about including any such papers in the first place).

- If at all possible or appropriate, you are highly encouraged to include a demo component. You can use code or demos from the Web or implement your own (this could even coincide with your project if your presentation comes later in the semester).

- Be sure to involve your colleagues. When you are developing your presentation, identify places where you can ask other students for input, or topics that you want to open up for discussion.

- Because timing is hard to predict, you need to maintain some flexibility in terms of the topics you will cover. It is a good idea to have one or two sections in the latter half of your slides that you can skip depending on the time. When you are presenting, keep an eye on the time and adjust the pacing towards the end accordingly.

- Use of external sources and credit attribution: Be sure to explicitly give credit whenever you use material from other sources. If you "borrow" any slides or graphics, be sure to give the original source in small font on the bottom of each slide. If you show a demo based on somebody's code, be sure to clearly announce this. 

## üíª Group Project

Each 2-student group will implement and present a technical project, focusing on  technical details and experiments. More details about this [here](GroupProjects.md).

The following grading rules will be applied:

| **Name** | **Grade** |
|:-------:|:--------:|
| Presentation | 15p |
| Live (or pre-recorded) Demo | 5p |
| Q&A | 10p |

**‚ùóTime allocated for presentation: 10-15 minutes.**

**‚ùóTime allocated for questions: 5-10 minutes.**

**‚ùóNo extensive report is required, only a presentation and the source code.**

## üìã Peer Grading Reports
Each student can earn up to 30 points by submitting 3 peer reports (using [this template](peer_grading_form.docx)) on other students' lectures - 1 report per presentation - **provided they were present and actively engaged the presenters with questions**.

Reports will be anonymous to your colleagues. The scores in the reports will be used to calculate the peer portion of the presentation grade for the respective team. Reports should be submitted by email to Ana and Vlad. In the subject of the email, put "```<mm/dd>_<lecture_topic>```" - where mm/dd is the date of the lecture you are reviewing, and lecture topic is the title of the presentation.
