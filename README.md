## Group Presentation:

## Group Presentation:

Students will form groups of up to three and jointly develop a lecture on an assigned topic to be delivered on an assigned date. Each group member must deliver a portion of the presentation. The topics should be chosen from the [following list](GroupPresentation.md), highlighting the current State-of-the-Art (SoA) and discussing a range of applications related to the subject.

The following grading rules will be applied:
-**Initial signup**. After the Introductory lecture (9.10.2024) students will have to choose a topic and secure a date for their presentation. The Sheet will be made-availabe on the Teams platform in the first lecture.  Topic assignment is first come, first served, though in case nobody signs up for some topics, we may ask some students to switch to ensure coverage. Signup deadline for registered students is **9AM on October 13th.** **Students who fail to signup for a presentation date until deadline will be penalised by 10% of their final grade**.

-**Outline and Bibliography (20% of the presentation grade)** : By the end of Sunday the week before you are scheduled to present, one member of the group must send Ana and Vlad (by mail or Teams) a brief outline and list of references you plan to cover. **This is a real deadline -- failure to submit the outline on time will forfeit this portion of the grade for your team and may negatively affect the final presentation grade.**
- **Slides (30% of presentation grade)** : By the end of the day before the scheduled presentation, the group must send Ana and Vlad the slides in PowerPoint or PDF format, to be made available to all the students on the course webpage. Be sure to put your names on the title slide and an extended reading list on the final slide. Late submission of the slides will forfeit this portion of the grade. Please see the note on credit attribution below, as failure to follow those guidelines will negatively affect this portion of your grade.
- **Lecture presentation (40% of presentation grade)**: The presentations will be graded based on clarity, technical depth, successful synthesis of content from multiple papers, ability to involve the rest students, and the answers on the questions raised from both profesors and other students
- **[Peer Grading Reports](#peer-grading-reports) (10% of presentation grade)** :- this corresponds to the average grade given by fellow colleagues **present during the presentation**. By present, we mean he/she asked at least one question and afterwards provide their opinion on the presentation and upload a final report using [this template](peer_grading_form.docx)

## Group Project

Each 2-student group will implement and present a technical project, chosen from the [following list](GroupProjects.md), focusing on  technical details and experiments.

The following grading rules will be applied:
- 50%: Project presentation and Q&A
- 50%: Project Live Demo, after the presentation

**No extensive report is required, only a presentation and source code.**

## Peer Grading Reports
Each student can obtain 10 points by writing two reports (using [this template](peer_grading_form.docx)) on other students' presentations (at least 2 different presentations), **to which they were present**, and verbally offer their opinion after the presentation.

## Important deadlines:

| **Name** | **Date** |

|  Group Presentation: Topic Choosing | |
|  Group Presentation: Submission  |   |
|  Group Presentation: Signup |   |
